	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>Hi!  You've happened upon the GAVisTool website.
	(I know; it doesn't look very impressive.)  Anyhow, this
	site is designed to introduce you to the GAVisTool software,
	and show you how to use it.  Some basic knowledge of
	geometric algebra (GA) is assumed.  For more information
	on that, the following links come highly recommended by yours truely.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.science.uva.nl/ga/">The University of Amsterdam GA Website</a>
		-- Here you'll find tutorials on GA and CGA using the GAViewer software.
		After visiting this site, you may not decide to come back to this one.</li>
		<li><a href="http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/">Geometric Calculus R & D Home Page</a>
		-- Maintained by David Hestenes himself, this site contains a great deal of information
		on GA and GC, though perhaps not very accessible to the average reader.</li>
		<li><a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/">Professor Macdonald's Home Page</a>
		-- Professor Macdonald is the author of a number of introductory undergraduate
		texts on the subjects of linear and geometric algebra, as well as geometric
		calculus.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~clifford/">The University of Cambridge GA Website</a>
		-- The researchers at this university have written a book on GA targeted at physicists, but
		you don't have to one to get something out of their book.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Those are just a few sources.  Googling the internet, you're bound to run into
	several tutorials on GA that a number of people have been kind enough to put together.</p>
	
	<p>That said, what is GAVisTool?  GAVisTool is an interactive computer graphics program
	designed to demonstrate and explore concepts from GA and conformal geometric algebra.
	It provides the user with a computation environment and view of 3D Euclidean space
	where experaments may be rigged.  The term rig is used here in the same sense as it
	is in common modeling programs such as Maya.</p>
	
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	
	<p>To get started, you need the GAVisTool software installed on your computer.
	This is as simple as copying down the executable from <a href="">here</a>.
	At the time of this writing, only windows is supported.  If you prefer to
	download the source code and compile the project, you can do that by visiting
	the GAVisTool project on git-hub
	<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/GAVisTool">here</a>, and then
	simply clone the repository.  Alternatively, you can download a ZIP file of
	the project from
	<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/GAVisTool/zipball/master">here</a>,
	or a tar-ball from
	<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/GAVisTool/tarball/master">here</a>.

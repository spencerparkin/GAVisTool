	<p>
	GAVisTool is a windows application based upon
	the cross-platform windowing tool-kit <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>.
	Comparable to <a href="http://www.clucalc.info/">CLUCalc</a> and
	<a href="http://www.science.uva.nl/ga/viewer/content_viewer.html">GAViewer</a>,
	it provides a means of experimenting with and visualizing elements of GA.
	It is important to realize that GAVisTool was not primarily developed with any user other
	than the author in mind.  That being the case, you will find little or no
	documentation on how to use it.  For that reason, the reader is directed
	to <a href="http://www.clucalc.info/">CLUCalc</a> or
	<a href="http://www.science.uva.nl/ga/viewer/content_viewer.html">GAViewer</a>.

	When GAVisTool comes up, it presents two windows to the user.
	One is a console window where commands can be input and results
	given in a scrollable window showing continuous output.
	The other window presents a 3D visualization of elements
	created and destroyed through the use of the console.
	The canvas window follows.

	And here is a screen-shot of the console window after having
	generated the visualization shown in the screen-shot above.

	<p>UNDER CONSTRUCTION -- If you are visiting this site, know that it is under construction,
	and nothing here is fully deployed or ready to be used yet.</p>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>Hi!  You've happened upon the GAVisTool website.
	(I know; it doesn't look like much.)  Anyhow, this
	site is designed to introduce you to the GAVisTool software,
	and show you how to use it.  Some basic knowledge of
	geometric algebra (GA) is assumed.  For more information
	on that, the following links come highly recommended by yours truely.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.science.uva.nl/ga/">The University of Amsterdam GA Website</a>
		-- Here you'll find tutorials on GA and CGA using the GAViewer software.
		After visiting this site, you may not decide to come back to this one.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~clifford/">The University of Cambridge GA Website</a>
		-- The researchers at this university have written a book on GA targeted at physicists, but
		you don't have to one to get something out of their book.</li>
		<li><a href="http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/">Geometric Calculus R & D Home Page</a>
		-- Maintained by David Hestenes himself, this site contains a great deal of information
		on GA and GC, though perhaps not very accessible to the average reader.</li>
		<li><a href="http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/">Professor Macdonald's Home Page</a>
		-- Professor Macdonald is the author of a number of introductory undergraduate
		texts on the subjects of linear and geometric algebra, as well as geometric
		calculus.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Those are just a few sources.  Googling the internet, you're bound to run into
	several tutorials on GA that a number of people have been kind enough to put together.</p>
	
	<p>All that said, what is GAVisTool?  GAVisTool is an interactive computer graphics program
	designed to demonstrate and explore concepts from GA and conformal geometric algebra (CGA).
	It provides the user with a computation environment and view of 3D Euclidean space
	where experiments may be rigged.  The term "rig" is used here in the same sense that it
	is used in common modeling programs such as Maya.  The following link takes you to a
	tutorial on how to use the software along with a list of subsequent tutorials at the end.</p>
	
	<a href="tutorial.html">The GAVisTool Tutorial</a>
	
	<p>Who is the intended audience for the GAVisTool program?  To be honest, the only
	intended user of GAVisTool is myself, and it is easy to see that the program is a work in progress.
	Keep this in mind if you actually try to use it to learn anything about CGA or do any reserach that
	involves CGA.  But if this is the case, why create a website with tutorials for
	potential users?  Well, while I cannot devote the time and resources to fully maintain
	the software for other users, I enjoy sharing knowledge about CGA, and one way to do
	that is through the GAVisTool program.  It would be interesting to me to hear about
	anyone who might have been able to benefit from the program, but again, I have written
	it purely as an exercise in learning CGA for myself.  Additionally, the program may be
	of interest to prospective employers; though I sincerely hope to remain in my current
	vocation as long as possible.</p>
	
	<h2>Personal Research</h2>
	
	As stated earlier, GAVisTool was written soley for the purpose of aiding in my own
	personal research on CGA, which mainly involves simply learning what it is, and then
	trying to figure out how I might use it or expand upon it.  I have a few white papers,
	currently under review, which, pending acceptance, may come out in the
	<a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/aaca/">AACA journal</a>.
	I cannot include links to them here, (since forfeit of
	copyright is a requirement of publishing in the jounral), but I can publish here
	papers I've written that I do not plan to publish anywhere else.  They are as follows.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="CGAIntro.pdf">An Introduction to CGA</a> -- A work in progress, this is
		my attempt to provide an
		introductory treatment of CGA.  Writing it has been the main vehicle to my
		own learning of CGA while consulting other sources.  It is essentially a
		compilation of all my notes on CGA.  If you get that far, ignore section 9.</li>

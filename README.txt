This is the root directory for the GAVisTool project.

The Code/ directory contains all source code for the project.
The ScriptCode/ directory contains scripts that can be executed
by the GAVisTool program.  The Doc/ directory contains files
that document the project for users and developers.  The Build/
directory contains files that are generated when the project
is built, such as the executable.  It is ignored by git, so you're
free to blow away the build directory if you need to.  The Platform/
directory contains platform-specific project files.

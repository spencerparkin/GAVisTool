Geometric Algebra Visualization Tool

This project is basically just a rip-off of GAViewer with some ideas taken from CLUCalc.  It is not worth anyone's time.  I developed it for myself for a few reasons:

1. I didn't care to learn GAViewer or CLUCalc,
2. I felt like a deeper understanding of GA and CGA could be had by writing something on my own from the ground up,
3. Sometimes I'm not content with understanding how something works on the surface.  I need to completely understand how it works from the inside out.

All that said, I still believe that where I've learned the most is in the time I've spent with a pencil, paper and a good imagination.  These visualization tools can produce image results from pre-conceived experiments that you might not have predicted in your mind, but there really is no substitute for doing a lot of work on paper.  Those are my thoughts on that matter.

But like I said before, this program is not worthy anyone's time or effort to use.  It's just a personal project.  If someone was able to use it and benefit from it, however, I would be interested in hearing about that.

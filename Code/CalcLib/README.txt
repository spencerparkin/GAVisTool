CalcLib
=======

CalcLib is a library of classes that can be used to perform calculations
in various algebras; most notably, geometric algebra.  As of this writing,
it can only do a limited amount of symbolic manipulation, but is mainly
useful for evaluating expressions composed from literal values anyway.
The calculator language is nothing more than the language of mathematics
as far as unary, binary and function syntax.  Calculator expressions are
parsed and compiled into expression trees that then can be evaluated in
the context a given environment.  The environment may also play a role in
the compilation process, so a given expression tree may be partial to
execution in only certain environments.  An environment represents the
algebra within which the user is working.  It defines the types of numbers
that are used in that algebra, the operations of that algebra, and the
available functions.  The execution environment also maintains a space of
pre-defined variables and user-defined variables.  In some cases it may be
useful that the final result in the evaluation of an expression tree, (which
is the result of the root evaluator), be such that what it prints is also
parsable/compilable as an expression tree, but this is not a requirement.
Some numbers print as latex, so that they can be printed as such.  The underlying
number class of an environment is responsible for knowing how to do symbolic or
any other types of manipulations, (such as taking a derivative or factoring a
polynomial), on general elements of the environment's algebra.  No such knowledge
is or ought to be assumed in the core library.  The various environments may be
thought of as extensions to the core library, which doesn't do anything without
a given environment anyway.

Lastly, I would add a disclaimer here that this library is purely expiremental,
and was written as a personal project.  I don't guarentee the accuracy of any
result generated by this library, so you'll just have to take it for what it's worth.
The main purpose of this library is that of studying geometric algebra and
its various applications in geometry.  Environments for other algebras represent
other interests I have in mathematics.

Here are some helpful notes on installation for developers, thanks to David Manura.

Download wxWidgets 2.8.12 <http://www.wxwidgets.org/>.
Set "#define wxUSE_GLCANVAS 1" in include\wx\msw\setup.h .
Set "USE_OPENGL = 1" in build\msw\config.vc .
cd wxMSW-2.8.12\build\msw
nmake -f makefile.vc  (from Visual Studio Command prompt)
Build GAVisTool\Platform\Win32GAVisTool\Win32GAVisTool.sln in
VisualStudio (it worked for me in Visual C++ 2008 but perhaps will
work in 2010 and 2012 as well).
In Win32GAVisTool.rc, I needed to comment out "#include "afxres.h"
(file didn't exist) and comment out "LANGUAGE LANG_ENGLISH,
SUBLANG_ENGLISH_US" (undefined symbols).

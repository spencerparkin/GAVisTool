In this directory you'll find various papers on geometric algebra
and other papers that document the usage of GAVisTool.  At the time
of this writing, the reader is asked to be forgiving of the current
state of the quality of these documents, as many of them are drafts,
have not been peer reviewed, and contain material that requires a
great deal of rigor, much of which is not quite there yet.

The GADoc/ directory contains a paper introducing geometric algebra.
The ATreatmentOfCGA/ directory contains a paper that, (you guess it),
gives an introductory treatment of the conformal model of geometric
algebra.  The ProductAlgorithm/ directory documents the algorithms
used by GAVisTool to perform various products in geometric algebra.
The GAVisToolMath/ directory contains a paper documenting the math
used by GAVisTool in its use of CGA.

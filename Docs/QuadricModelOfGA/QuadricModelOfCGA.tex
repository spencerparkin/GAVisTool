\begin{abstract}
A great achievement of the conformal model of geometric algebra is that the elements
of computation are representatives of geometry, and may therefore be thought of as geometry.
A limitation of the model, however, is its inability to represent all quadric surfaces.
Set forth in this paper, the quadric model of geometric algebra, while maintaining the idea
of geometries as elements of computation, overcomes this limitation at the expense of
added complexity and dimension.

\section{Finding The Quadric Equation}

Taking our que from \cite{WikipediaQuadricEntry}, the $n$-dimensional quadric surfaces
may be characterized as the set of all projective points in an $(n+1)$-dimensional homogeneous space
satisfying a matrix equation involving a symmetric matrix.  We will let $\V^{n+1}$ be an
$(n+1)$-dimensional vector space and identify vectors in this space with projective
points of $n$-dimensional space in the usual manner.  That is, letting $\{e_i\}_{i=0}^n$
be an orthonormal basis for $\V^{n+1}$, we identify the $n$-dimensional point
represented by any $p\in\V^{n+1}$ as the point $p/(p\cdot e_0)$ in the $e_0=1$ plane.

Letting $\{\alpha_{ij}\}\subset\R$ with $0\leq i\leq j\leq n$ be the scalar elements of a symmetric
matrix, an $n$-dimensional quadric surface is the projective solution set to the
matrix equation
\begin{equation}\label{equ_quadric_matrix_equation}
0 = p\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\alpha_{00} & \alpha_{01} & \dots & \alpha_{0n} \\
\alpha_{01} & \alpha_{11} & \dots & \alpha_{1n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\alpha_{0n} & \alpha_{1n} & \dots & \alpha_{nn}
\end{array}\right]p^T,
\end{equation}
where here we have abused notation by interpreting the vector $p$ taken from $\V^{n+1}$ as
a row-vector with $p^T$ as the corresponding column-vector.  Written another
way without abusing notation, we have
\begin{equation}\label{equ_lowlevel_equation}
0 = \sum_{i=0}^n\sum_{j=i}^n\sigma_{ij}\alpha_{ij}(p\cdot e_i)(p\cdot e_j),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{ij}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{ij} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \mbox{if $i=j$,} \\
2 & \mbox{if $i\neq j$.}
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
The form \eqref{equ_quadric_matrix_equation} lends itself to the study
of quadrics using matrix algebra, while the form \eqref{equ_lowlevel_equation}
may be thought of as a low-level form of the equation in geometric algebra.
What we might think of as a high-level form in geometric algebra, coming from
a framework of compuation, may provide a better means of studying quadrics
using geometric algebra.  We procede now to develop such a form.

Let $\W^{2(n+1)}$ denote a $2(n+1)$-dimensional vector space
having $\{e_i\}_{i=0}^{2n+1}$ as a set orthonormal basis vectors
generating it.  The vector space $\V^{n+1}$ is therefore a vector
sub-space of $\W^{2(n+1)}$ and we will let $\Vb^{n+1}$ denote
the $(n+1)$-dimensional vector sub-space of $\W^{2(n+1)}$ that
is complement to $\V^{n+1}$.  It is then helpful to introduce the
notation $\overline{p}$ as the vector in $\Vb^{n+1}$ related to the
vector $p\in\V^{n+1}$ by the equation
\begin{equation}
\overline{p} = Rp\tilde{R},
\end{equation}
where $R$ is a rotor defined as
\begin{equation}
R = 2^{-n/2}\prod_{i=0}^n\left(1-e_ie_{i+n+1}\right).
\end{equation}
This idea comes from \cite{DoranHestenes93}, and it is easy to see
that for any integer $i\in[0,n]$, we have $\overline{e}_i=e_{i+n+1}$
and $\overline{e}_{i+n+1}=e_i$.  Notice that the over-bar operator
is an outermorphic function and that we may apply it to any element
of the geometric algebra $\G(\W^{2(n+1)})$.

We are now ready to give the high-level form of equation \eqref{equ_lowlevel_equation} as
\begin{equation}\label{equ_highlevel_equation}
0 = p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot B,
\end{equation}
where $B\in\G(\W^{2(n+1)})$ is a bivector of the form
\begin{equation}
B = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=0}^n\sum_{j=i}^n\alpha_{ij}(e_i\overline{e}_j+(-1)^{\sigma_{ij}}\overline{e}_ie_j).
\end{equation}
Here, as in the form \eqref{equ_quadric_matrix_equation} where we may think of
the symmetric matrix as representative of the quadric, the bivector $B$ may also be thought
of as representative of this quadric.

Realizing that we need to be careful, because the inner product is not associative,
it is interesting to write equation \eqref{equ_highlevel_equation} in a form
similar to that of equation \eqref{equ_quadric_matrix_equation}, which
resembles conjugation of $B$ by $p$.  Doing so, we get $0 = p\cdot B\cdot\overline{p}$.

\section{Using The Quadric Equation}

Having developed the quadric equation \eqref{equ_highlevel_equation} in geometric algebra, we can
now benefit from the language of geometric algebra in using it to answer questions about quadric geometry.

Notice that in our model we can make a distinction between members of $\V^{n+1}$ that are
representative of points and those representative of directions.  Specifically, a vector $v\in\V^{n+1}$
is a direction if and only if $v\cdot e_0=0$.  While we will use an arrow accent to distinguish
between direction vectors and position vectors, there should be no confusion on the form
of a vector and what we intend it to represent when we refer to it as a direction or a vector.
Similarly, we will take the liberty of referring to bivectors taken
from $\G(\V^{2(n+1)})$ as quadrics.  This helps eliminate phrases that would otherwise sound a bit
too pedantic.

With all of that said, letting $f:\V^{n+1}\to\R$ be the function defined as
\begin{equation}
f(x) = x\wedge\overline{x}\cdot B,
\end{equation}
we arrive at our first lemma as follows.
\begin{lemma}
Given any quadric $B$, if for all direction vectors $\vec{v}\in\V^{n+1}$,
we have $f(\vec{v})=0$, then $B$ is a linear (flat) quadric.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For any pair of homogenized points $p,x\in\V^{n+1}$, there is a direction $\vec{x}\in\V^{n+1}$
such that $x=p+\vec{x}$.  We then find that
\begin{equation}
f(x) = f(p+\vec{x}) = \nabla_{\vec{x}}f(p),
\end{equation}
in the case that $p$ is on $B$, where $\nabla_{\vec{x}}f(p)$ is the directional
derivative of $f$ at $p$ in the direction of $\vec{x}$.  It follows that the tangent
space of any point on the quadric is also in the quadric.  The quadric is therefore
flat at any point upon its surface.
\end{proof}

Show that $\nabla_{\vec{x}}f(p)=\vec{x}\cdot\nabla f(p)$.  It would follow that
$\nabla f(p)$ is normal to the surface of the quadric, right?

How do we find the flat quadric that is tangent to and touching another quadric?
It might be
\begin{equation}
(p\cdot\nabla f(p))e_0\overline{e}_0 + e_0\overline{\nabla f(p)}+\overline{e}_0\nabla f(p).
\end{equation}

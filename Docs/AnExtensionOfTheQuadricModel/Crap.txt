In this section we show that there is a geometric algebra where
the $k$-blades of that algebra represent the intersection of $k$ surfaces.\footnote{In
algebraic geometry, these are called algebraic sets or sometimes algebraic varieties.}
The key observation is that $\B(\W)$, (which is what we'll use to denote the set
of all bivectors in $\G(\W)$), is simply a linear space, and we can therefore
explore the geometric algebra, denoted by $\G([\B(\W)])$, that is generated by this linear space.

We begin by introducing $[\cdot]$ as a linear function defined on $\B(\W)$, mapping bivectors
of this space into a vector space that we'll denote by $[\B(\W)]$.  For any pair of linearly
independent vectors $x,y\in\W$, we let $[x\wedge y]$ denote a vector in $[\B(\W)]$.  Being a linear
function, we see that $[\cdot]$ is determined entirely by how it maps a basis for $\B(\W)$.
Furthermore, for any two blades $a,b\in\B(\W)$, we will let
\begin{equation}
[a]\cdot[b] = a\cdot b,
\end{equation}
so that thereby $\G([\B(\W)])$ inherits its signature from $\G(\W)$.  We will
use a bold front for elements of $\G([\B(\W)])$ to set them apart from
elements of $\G(\W)$.

What we see now is that if $\{E_i\}_{i=1}^k$ is a set of $k$ surfaces taken from $\B(\W)$,
then the $k$-blade $\mathbf{E}$, given by
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E} = \bigwedge_{i=1}^k[E_i],
\end{equation}
is representative of the intersection of these $k$ surfaces as the set
of all points $p\in\V^e$, such that
\begin{equation}\label{equ_dual_surf}
0=[P(p)\wedge\overline{P}(p)]\cdot\mathbf{E},
\end{equation}
provided that $\{[E_i]\}_{i=1}^k$ is a linearly independent set.
We refer to $\mathbf{E}$ here as a dual surface in the case that
we are interpreting it as a surface by equation \eqref{equ_dual_surf}.
If we are interpreting $\mathbf{E}$ as a surface by the equation
\begin{equation}
0=[P(p)\wedge\overline{P}(p)]\wedge\mathbf{E},
\end{equation}
then we refer to $\mathbf{E}$ as a direct surface.  Any blade $\mathbf{E}\in\G([\B(\W)])$
is simultaneously representative of two surfaces, one dually, the other directly.\footnote{It is
sometimes useful to reinterpret a dual geometry as a direct geometry, or vice versa.  For example,
while the outer product of two dual geometries may be a dual imaginary intersection, it may
be a real geometry in direct form.}
It can be shown that a given surface is simultaneously represented by two blades
in $\G([\B(\W)])$ that are duals of one another.

We will now let $\mathbf{I}$ denote, not the psuedo-scalar of $\G([\B(\W)])$, but
the psuedo-scalar of a desired geometric sub-algebra of $\G([\B(\W)])$.  The desired
sub-algebra is generated by the desired sub-space of $[\B(\W)]$.  Our first inclination
might be that this space is the set of vectors
\begin{equation}
\{[x\wedge\overline{y}]:x,y\in\V\},
\end{equation}
which is of dimension $(n+2)^2$, but what we'll find later on is that we want
the dimension of our sub-space to be as small as possible.  To that end,
notice that there
are $n+2$ basis vectors for $\V$ by table \eqref{equ_vector_spaces},
and so to represent a surface $E\in\G(\W)$ by Definition~\ref{def_surface},
we really only need $(n+2)(n+3)/2$ of the $(n+2)^2$ basis 2-blades spanning $\B(\W)$.
We will let $\mathbf{I}$ be
the psuedo-scalar of the geometric sub-algebra of $\G([\B(\W)])$ generated
by this vector sub-space of $[\B(\W)]$ having this irreducible dimension.

To use $\mathbf{I}$ now to take duals of blades $\mathbf{E}\in\G([\B(\W)])$ to
switch between the dual and direct forms, we must restrict our attention
to those surfaces $E\in\G(\W)$ of reduced form.  We will assume this
reduced form from now on.

Before moving on, we should note here that finding the transformation $\mathbf{E}'$ of
a $k$-blade $\mathbf{E}\in\G([\B(\W)])$ by a versor $V\in\G(\V)$ can be done, if
we can find a factorization $\mathbf{E}_1\wedge\dots\wedge\mathbf{E}_k$ of $\mathbf{E}$.
Having such a factorization, we may proceed to write
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}' = \bigwedge_{i=1}^k[V\overline{V}[\mathbf{E}_i]^{-1}(V\overline{V})^{-1}].
\end{equation}
The problem of blade factorization was given a great deal of treatment in \cite{}.

\section{Fitting Surfaces To Points}

We have already seen that $\G([\B(\W)])$ can be used to represent
the intersections of surfaces in both direct and dual form, but, unlike
the conformal model of geometric algebra, it appears that working
in $\G([\B(\W)])$ is not as practical in the sense that we cannot easily
find canonical forms for certain types of geometries, much less use
them to interpret an intersection result.  Nevertheless, we show
in this section that $\G([\B(\W)])$ does have an interesing application.

Recall that while the outer product of dual geometries can give us a
dual intersection, the outer product of direct geometries can give us
a geometry that is at least the union of the two geometries taken in the product.
One application of this idea is that of fitting a surface to a set of points.

Letting $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^k$ be a set of $k$ points taken from $\V^e$,
we observe that if the corresponding set $\{[P(p_i)\wedge\overline{P}(p_i)]\}_{i=1}^k$
is a linearly independent set, then the elements $\mathbf{E}\in\G([\B(\W)])$, given by
\begin{equation}\label{equ_point_fit}
\mathbf{E} = \bigwedge_{i=1}^k[P(p_i)\wedge\overline{P}(p_i)],
\end{equation}
is directly representative of a surface containing all of these points.  The question
then remains: under what condition on the set of points in $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^k$
is the set $\{[P(p_i)\wedge\overline{P}(p_i)]\}_{i=1}^k$ linearly independent;
and under these circumstances, what surface do we get with $\mathbf{E}$
in equation \eqref{equ_point_fit}?  This question, when formulated
in terms of the conformal model of geometric algebra,  is easy to answer,
but not so easy to answer here.  Not being
able to find an answer, the author is compelled to leave it as an open question for the reader.

Another question to consider is that of how many points are needed
to fit a surface of some dimension.  A $k$-blade $\mathbf{E}\in\G([\B(\W)])$
dually represents a surface of dimension $n-k+1$, and therefore,
the blade $\mathbf{EI}$ of grade
\begin{equation}
\mbox{grade}(\mathbf{I})-k
\end{equation}
directly represents
such a surface, which grade is also the number of points we would need
to fit the surface.  Seeing that with the more points we have, the less likely
the set $\{[P(p_i)\wedge\overline{P}(p_i)]\}_{i=1}^k$ is of being linearly independent,
the reader can now see why
we have restricted our attention to only the reduced form of surfaces $E\in\G(\W)$.

\section{Closing Remarks}

If the reader has come this far, then it is likely that he or she has been willing
to forgive the obvious inadequacies of the author; most notably a lack of
awareness of modern day theories of quadratic forms and the entire subject of algebraic
geometry.  (See \cite{} for an in-depth history of quadratic forms.  A history
of algebraic geometry is given with similar uses of strange and foreign terms in \cite{}.)

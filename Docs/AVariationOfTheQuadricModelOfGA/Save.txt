\section{A Companion Algebra $\G([\B(\W)])$ For $\G(\W)$}

In this section we show that the notions of dual and direct
geometries found in the conformal model of geometric algebra may
be likewise achieved in our model for quartic surface by using
a geometric algebra $\G([\B(\W)])$ in conjunction with $\G(\W)$.
To help differentiate between the elements of these two geometric
algebras, we will use a bold-face font for members of $\G([\B(\W)])$.

Let $\B(\W)$ denote the set of all bivectors $B\in\G(\W)$ of
the form
\begin{equation}
B = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i\overline{b}_i,
\end{equation}
where each of $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^k$ and $\{b_i\}_{i=1}^k$ is a sequence
of $k$ vectors taken from $\V$.  We observe now that $\B(\W)$ is
a linear space, and then seek a geometric algebra generated by this
space.  To that end, let $[]:\B(\W)\to[\B(\W)]$ be a linear function
mapping the bivectors of $\B(\W)$ into a vector space we'll denote by $[\B(\W)]$.
Being a linear function, $[]$ is determined entirely by how it maps a basis
of $\B(\W)$.  Given any basis of $\B(\W)$, therefore, we let $[]$ map
this basis to a set of vectors such that for any two blades $A,B\in\B(\W)$, we have
\begin{equation}
[A]\cdot[B]=A\cdot B.
\end{equation}
We can now let $\G([\B(\W)])$ denote the anti-Euclidean geometric algebra
generated by $[\B(\W)]$, define the function $\rho:\V^e\to[\B(\W)]$ as
\begin{equation}
\rho(p) = [P(p)\wedge\overline{P}(p)],
\end{equation}
and then give the following two definitions.
\begin{defn}\label{def_dual_surf}
For any blade $\mathbf{B}\in\G([\B(\W)])$, if we are refering to it as
a dual surface, then we are interpreting it as the surface that
is the set of all points $p\in\V^e$ such that
\begin{equation}
0 = \rho(p)\cdot\mathbf{B}.
\end{equation}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}\label{def_direct_surf}
For any blade $\mathbf{B}\in\G([\B(\W)])$, if we are refering to it as a
direct surface, then we are interpreting it as the surface that
is the set of all points $p\in\V^e$ such that
\begin{equation}
0 = \rho(p)\wedge\mathbf{B}.
\end{equation}
\end{defn}
Letting $\mathbf{I}$ denote the unit psuedo-scalar of $\G([\B(\W)])$, it is
not hard to show that if a given blade $\mathbf{B}$ represents a surface
dually, then its positive or negative dual $\pm\mathbf{BI}$ does so directly,
and vice versa.\footnote{Note that it is sometimes useful to reinterpret a given
blade $\mathbf{B}$.  For example, while the dual intersection of two dual
surfaces may be imaginary, it may become a different yet real surface when interpreted
as a direct surface.}

We see now by Definition~\ref{def_dual_surf} that for any surface $E\in\B(\W)$,
the vector $[E]$ is its dual surface.  We can now benefit from the geometric
algebra $\G([\B(\W)])$ in two ways.  First, by realizing that the outer product
of any two dual surfaces, if non-zero, is a dual surface representative of the intersection
of the two surfaces taken in that product; and secondly, by realizing that the
outer product of any two direct surfaces, if non-zero, is a direct surface representative of a
surface that is at least the union of the surfaces taken in the product.  The proof
of these facts is well known, and so will not be presented here.

While it is clear what we get in an intersection of two dual surfaces, it is not immediately
clear what we get in the combination of two direct surfaces.  One way to begin to find out
may be to study the ability to fit surfaces to points as can be done in the conformal
model of geometric algebra, because in that model, all geometries, except the
flat points, can be factored as an outer product of points fitting the geometry, provided
the points satisfy specific constraints.

Given a set $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^k$, with
$1\leq k<\mbox{grade}(\mathbf{I})=(n+2)^2$, of $k$ points
taken from $\V^e$, if the set of vectors $\{\rho(p_i)\}_{i=1}^k$ is linearly
independent, then the direct surface $\mathbf{B}$, given by
\begin{equation}\label{equ_fit_points}
\mathbf{B} = \bigwedge_{i=1}^k\rho(p_i),
\end{equation}
must fit the $k$ points.  Assuming planar intersections, a $k$-blade $\mathbf{B}\in\G([\B(\W)])$
is dually representative
of a surface of dimension $n-k+1$, and therefore directly representative
of a surface of dimension $n-((n+2)^2-k)+1$, which brings up the odd
prospect of geometries with no or negative dimension.  It would seem that
$k=(n+2)^2-1$ points are needed to fit an $n$-dimensional surface; however,
it is possible to fit such a surface with just $k=(n+2)(n+3)/2-1$ points if
we restrict ourselves to the reduced form of surfaces $[\mathbf{E}]^{-1}\in\B(\W)$,
similar to what we did with equation \eqref{equ_quadric_reduced_form} above.

In any case, the question now remains: under what circumstances of the set $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^k$,
if any exist, is the set $\{\rho(p_i)\}_{i=1}^k$ linearly independent; and under those
circumstances,
what surface $\mathbf{B}$ do we get in equation \eqref{equ_fit_points}?  The
version of this question for the conformal model of geometric algebra is easy
to answer; but, not being able to find the answer here for our present model,
the author is compelled to leave it as an open question.

Lastly, given a versor $V\in\G(\V)$, we can see
that for any dual surface $\mathbf{E}\in[\B(\W)]$, if we can find a factorization
of this $k$-blade, such as $\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}_1\wedge\dots\wedge\mathbf{E}_k$,
then the
transformation $\mathbf{E}'$ of this surface $\mathbf{E}$ by $V$, is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}' = \bigwedge_{i=1}^k[V\overline{V}[\mathbf{E}_i]^{-1}(V\overline{V})^{-1}].
\end{equation}
This illustrates one way that the algebras $\G(\W)$ and $\G([\B(\W)])$ might
work in concert with one another.  The problem of blade factorization is
given a great deal of treatment in \cite{}.

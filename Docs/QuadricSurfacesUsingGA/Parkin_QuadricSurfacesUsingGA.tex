\begin{abstract}
Inspired by the conformal model of geometric algebra,
a similar model of geometry is developed for the set
of all quadric surfaces in $n$-dimensional space.  Bivectors of the geometric algebra
are found to be representative of quadric surfaces.  Coordinate free canonical forms
of such bivectors are found for common quadric surfaces.  The model is investigated
for usefulness and compared to the conformal model.

\section{The Construction Of The Model}

The stage for this model of $n$-dimensional quadric surfaces is set in the geometric
algebra we'll denote by $\G$ that is generated by a vector space $\W$ of dimension
$2(n+1)$.  Letting $\{e_i\}_{i=0}^{2n+1}$ be an orthonormal set of basis vectors
generating $\W$, we let $\{e_i\}_{i=0}^n$ be such a set of vectors generating
the $(n+1)$-dimensional vector sub-space $\V$ of $\W$ in which we'll impose the
usual interpretation of $(n+1)$-dimensional homogeneous space.  Specifically,
a vector $v\in\V$ with $v\cdot e_0\neq 0$ represents the point given by\footnote{Throughout this
paper we let the outer product take precedence over the inner product, and the geometric product
take precedence over both the inner and outer products.}
\begin{equation}
e_0\cdot\frac{e_0\wedge v}{e_0\cdot v}
\end{equation}
in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, imposing the usual correlation between $n$ dimensional
vectors and $n$-dimensional points\footnote{The correlation between
vectors and points spoken of here is that of having a vector represent the point
at its tip when its tail is placed at the origin.}.  We will take the liberty of letting vectors $v\in\V$ with $v\cdot e_0=0$
represent points under the same interpretation of which has been just spoken, as
well as pure directions with magnitude.  The intended interpretation will be made clear
in the context of our usage.  We will refer to all vectors $v\in\V$ with $v\cdot e_0\neq 0$
as projective points, and such vectors with $v\cdot e_0=0$ as non-projective points.

We now introduce a function defined on $\G$ having the outermorphic property.
This means it is a linear function and that it preserves the outer product.  We will
use over-bar notation to denote the use of this function.  Doing so, for any
element $E\in\G$, we define $\overline{E}$ as
\begin{equation}
\overline{E} = RE\tilde{R},
\end{equation}
where the rotor $R$ is given by
\begin{equation}
R = 2^{-(n+1)/2}\prod_{i=0}^n\left(1-e_ie_{i+n+1}\right).
\end{equation}
As the reader can check, for any integer $i\in[0,n]$, we have $\overline{e_i}=e_{i+n+1}$.
The rotor $R$ simply rotates any $k$-vector taken from the geometric algebra generated
by $\V$ and rotates it into the identical geometric algebra generated by the vector
space complement to $\V$ with respect to $\W$.  This idea can be found in \cite{DoranHestenes93}.
We will find the over-bar notation convenient when perform algebraic manipulations in our model.

We are now ready to give the definition by which we will interpret bivectors in $\G$
as $n$-dimensional quadric surfaces.
\begin{definition}\label{def_quadric}
For any element $E\in\G$, we say that $E$ is representative of the $n$-dimensional
quadric surface generated by the set of all projective points $v\in\V$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{equ_quadric_condition}
0 = p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot E.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
Notice that when $\mbox{grade}(E)>1$, there is no ambiguity, despite the non-associativity
of the inner product, in rewriting equation
\eqref{equ_quadric_condition} as
\begin{equation}
0 = p\cdot E\cdot\overline{p},
\end{equation}
which resembles a sort of conjugation of $E$ by $p$.  This may perhaps be a more
familiar form for readers familiar with the study of quadric surfaces in projective geometry.
Also notice that we have not required that $E$ be a bivector in Definition~\ref{def_quadric},
because we may find this condition useful and meaningful for any element of $\G$.  For now,
however, we will restrict our attention to the case when $E$ is a bivector.

To see why Definition~\ref{def_quadric} works, simply notice that when $E$ is a bivector, we have
\begin{equation}\label{equ_homogeneous_polynomial}
p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot E=\sum_{i=0}^n\sum_{j=i}^n \lambda_{ij}(p\cdot e_i)(p\cdot e_j),
\end{equation}
which we can recognize as a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in the vector components of $p$.
The scalars $\lambda_{ij}$, with $0\leq i\leq j\leq n$, may be formulated in terms of $E$ by
\begin{equation}\label{equ_quadric_components}
\lambda_{ij} = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
e_i\overline{e_j}\cdot E & \mbox{if $i=j$,} \\
\left(e_i\overline{e_j}-\overline{e_i}e_j\right)\cdot E & \mbox{if $i\neq j$.}
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
It should be noted that bivectors do not uniquely represent quadric surfaces, not even up to scale.
This is apparent from equation \eqref{equ_quadric_components} when we see that for $i\neq j$,
we can freely choose certain components of the bivector without changing the represented
quadric so long as that their sum is still $-\lambda_{ij}$.  The problem this may pose in our model
comes from a very important result in the conformal model.  In the conformal model, if
two blades are known to represent the same geometry, then it can be shown that the
two blades are equal, up to scale.  In our present model, it may take more than just
homogenization to get a bivector known to represent a certain geometry into a
known canonical form.

Another important difference to point out here between our present model and the conformal model is that,
unlike what we can analogously expect from the point-definition of the conformal model,
here the 2-blade form $a\wedge\overline{a}$ found in Definition~\ref{def_quadric}, for
any projective point $a\in\V$ not at origin, does not represent the projective point $a$ under Definition~\ref{def_quadric}.
In homogenized form, the projective point represented by $a\wedge\overline{a}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
e_0 - \left(e_0\cdot\frac{e_0\wedge a}{e_0\cdot a}\right)^{-1},
\end{equation}
which is the reflection about the origin of the spherical reflection of the projective point $a$
about the unit-sphere centered at the origin.  The projective point $e_0$ at the origin
simply represents the empty point-set geometry, or the geometry of nothing.  It is also
easy to see that $a\wedge\overline{a}$ cannot represent itself, because there are no
null blades in our purely Euclidean geometric algebra $\G$.

\section{The Construction Of Quadric Surfaces In The Model}

Having constructed our model, we are now ready to find canonical forms of bivectors
representing a variety of well-known quadric surfaces.  Let us begin with the
spheroid, (a special case of ellipsoid), the circular cylinder, and the circular hyperboloid
of one sheet.  We will find that all of these surfaces share the same canonical form,
because they may all be characterized as the non-projective point solution set of the equation
\begin{equation}\label{equ_spheroid}
0 = -r^2 + (x-c)^2 + \lambda((x-c)\cdot v)^2
\end{equation}
in the non-projective point $x\in\V$, where $c\in\V$ is a non-projective
point denoting the center of the surface, $v\in\V$ is a unit-length direction
vector, $r\in\R$ is the radius of the geometry about the axis $v$ at $c$, and
$\lambda\in\R$ is a scalar indicating the type and extremity of the surface.
Specifically, if $\lambda<1$, we get a spheroid, if $\lambda=1$, we get
a circular cylinder, and if $\lambda>1$, we get a circular  hyperboloid.

Expanding equation \eqref{equ_spheroid}, we get
\begin{equation}
0 = x^2 - \lambda(x\cdot v)^2 - 2x\cdot (c+\lambda(c\cdot v)v) + c^2 + \lambda(c\cdot v)^2 - r^2,
\end{equation}
from which it is possible to factor out $p\wedge\overline{p}$
in terms of the inner product, where $p=e_0+x$
is a homogenized projective point.  Doing so, we see that the bivector
$E$ given by
\begin{equation}\label{equ_spheroid_bivector}
E = -\Omega + \lambda v\wedge\overline{v} + 2(c+\lambda(c\cdot v)v)\wedge\overline{e_0} - (c^2+\lambda(c\cdot v)^2-r^2)A,
\end{equation}
is representative of the three surface types by Definition~\ref{def_quadric}, where the constant
$\Omega$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\Omega=\sum_{i=1}^n e_i\overline{e_i},
\end{equation}
and $A$ is the constant defined as $A=e_0\overline{e_0}$.  We will find each of these useful as
frequently recurring constants in our calculations.

Such forms as that in equation \eqref{equ_spheroid_bivector} are useful, not only
for composition, but especially decomposition in the cases
where we have formulated what may, for example, be a spheroid by some other means.
This gives the model power as an analytical tool.  If we can solve a problem whose solution
is a bivector representative of a spheroid, then we can use this canonical form to answer
questions about that spheroid.  Where is its center?  What is its axis?  What is its radius
about that axis?  As is often the case in mathematics, decomposition is
harder than composition.

Referring to equation \eqref{equ_spheroid_bivector}, we can deduce...give
a decomposition of the spheroid once I know the form is correct.  Consider $E^2$.

% note that the canonical form is also a homogenized form.

% lastly, note that a generalization of this form probably exists
% that warps a sphere in any number of axes.

The following table summerizes a few additional canonical forms.
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\mbox{Geometry} & & \mbox{Canonical/Homogenized Form} \\
\hline
\mbox{Plane} & \vline & v\wedge\overline{e_0} - (c\cdot v)A \\
\hline
\mbox{Sphere} & \vline & \Omega - 2c\wedge\overline{e_0} + (c^2-r^2)A \\
\hline
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\section{Making Use Of The Model}

Admittedly, there is really nothing interesting about this model unless we can
prove that it has some utility.  The conformal model, for example, has at least
two great features.  The first is the utility of the wedge product in generating
intersections between geometries in dual form, or point-fitting between
geometries in direct form.  A good user of the conformal model can even
make use of dual imaginary intersections by reinterpreting them as real geometries
in direct form.  The second great feature of the conformal model is the
surprising fact that all geometries in the conformal model are also, as versors, conformal transformations
with geometric significance relative to the simultaneously represented geometry.
Realizing that all conformal geometries, (with the exception of flat points), have
a factorization in direct form as an outer product of points, the outermorphic
property of versor conjugation allows us to predict the action of any versor
transformation on almost any conformal geometry.

These are great features!  But what can the model at present do for us?  Well,
the first observation we must make is that the set of all known quadrics
is represented by the set of all bivectors in $\G$, underwhich the inner
and outer products are obviously not closed.  Only addition and subtraction
are closed in this set, and so we're left to wonder what we might be able
to prove about the addition and subtraction of $n$-dimensional quadric surfaces.
Letting $A,B\in\G$ be bivectors, it is not hard to see that $A+B$, under
Definition~\ref{def_quadric}, must represent at least the intersection, if any,
of the quadric surfaces $A$ and $B$, but this is not an exact answer to the
question of what surface $A+B$ represents.

% Show that the sum of a plane and a sphere is a sphere.
% Note that the prediction about their interesection was correct.

% Note the theorems of CGA that let us do intersections and fittings.
% Show why we can't apply them here.

% Can we get the conic sections?  We just need to intersect planes with quadrics, right?

It would be nice if our model could also represent the conic sections.
One way to do this, which, admittedly, is a bit lame, is to introduce
two new basis vectors $a$ and $b$, thereby quadrupling the dimension
of our geometric algebra.  Then, given any two bivectors $A,B$ in our
original $\G$, it would follow that the trivector $T$, given by
\begin{equation}
T = a\wedge A + b\wedge B,
\end{equation}
represents the intersection of the two quadric surfaces $A$ and $B$ by
Definition~\ref{def_quadric}.  To see this, simply note that
\begin{equation}
p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot T = (p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot A)a + (p\wedge\overline{p}\cdot B)b,
\end{equation}
and that $a\wedge b\neq 0$.  This expansion of the model is lame, because...

\section{Concluding Remarks}

That $\G$ was not something fancy like a Minkowski space or some other
type of non-Euclidean geometric algebra was perhaps our first clue from
the beginning that the potential for great things coming out of this model
was, let's say, less than likely.  On the other hand, it is very hard to see
all ends, and so perhaps there are deep results to be found or new insights
to be had using this method of studying quadric surfaces.  In any case,
geometric algebra has proven to be a fundamental, versital and unifying
language that extends mathematics beyond the real number line.  If not
using this model, it undoubtadly has its application in the study of quadric
surfaces using a better framework of calculation.

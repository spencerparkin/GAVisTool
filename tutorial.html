	<center><h1>The GAVisTool Tutorial</h1></center>
		
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	
	<p>To get started, you need the GAVisTool software installed on your computer.
	This is as simple as copying down the executable from <a href="GAVisTool.zip">here</a>.
	An optimized version is available <a href="GAVisToolNoSymb.zip">here</a>, which
	has the symbolic manipulation support compiled out.
	At the time of this writing, only windows is supported.  If you prefer to
	download the source code and compile the project, you can do that by visiting
	the GAVisTool project on git-hub
	<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/GAVisTool">here</a>, and then
	simply clone the repository.  Alternatively, you can download a ZIP file of
	the project from
	<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/GAVisTool/zipball/master">here</a>,
	or a tar-ball from
	<a href="https://github.com/spencerparkin/GAVisTool/tarball/master">here</a>.
	
	<h2>User Interface Overview</h2>
	
	<p>Upon executing the program, you are presented with two independent windows.
	The first, shown immediately below, is the console window where input commands
	are received in the bottom text-box and a stream of output given in the main
	part of the window.</p>
	
	<center><img src="images/consolestartup.jpg" alt="The GAVisTool console at start-up."></center>
	
	<p>The second window, shown below, is the canvas window where a view of 3D Euclidean space
	is given.  Geometric objects you create are displayed in this window, and
	removed when you destroy them.  The coordinate axes are not considered to
	be an official geometric object, but are shown simply as a reference to indicate spacial
	orientation and the camera's view relative to the origin.
	On start up, therefore, the canvas window is considered to show empty space.</p>
	
	<center><img src="images/canvasstartup.jpg" alt="The GAVisTool canvas at start-up."></center>
	
	<p>We proceed now by first learning to use the console window, and then graduate
	to its working in conjunction with the canvas window.</p>
	
	<h2>The Console</h2>
	
	<p>Entering text into the input text-box at the bottom of the console window,
	you should be able to easily reproduce the following screen-shot.  The expressions
	to the left of the arrows in the main window are exactly what the user typed,
	while the expressions to the right of the arrows are the results computed by the
	GAVisTool calculation engine.</p>
	
	<center><img src="images/consolebasicusage.jpg" alt="GAVisTool console basic usage."></center>
	
	<p>As you can see, a number of pre-defined variables are supported; namely,
	basis vectors for 3D Euclidean space, the unit psuedo-scalar for the geometric
	algebra generated by that space, and the unit psuedo-scalar for 3D CGA.  You can
	also set and use your own variables to create vectors, bivectors or any other
	type of element in geometric algebra.  To form these elements, the inner, outer
	and geometric products are supported through the use of the period, carot and
	asterisk characters, respectively.</p>
	
	<p>You'll also notice the sqrt() function.  This is one of the built-in functions
	supported by the calculation environment.  There is limited support for something
	that might be considered a user-defined function, and even primitive language constructs,
	such as for-loops and if-statements, but those are beyond the scope of this tutorial.</p>
	
	<p>One of the things that makes the GAVisTool computation engine slower than most
	is its limited support for symbolic manipulation, if you have that feature compiled
	into the exectuable.  See the following screen-shot.</p>
	
	<center><img src="images/consolesymbolusage.jpg" alt="GAVisTool console symbol usage."></center>
	
	<p>If you compiled GAVisTool, there is a way to compile all symbolic manipulation
	support out of the computation engine.  This should give you better performance.
	In any case, you'll notice above that there are variables beginning with a dollars sign.
	These variables are symbolic literal values, not the kind of variables you have
	already seen where you can store values into them and retrieve values from them.
	Symbolic literal values exist on the same par as numeric and string literal values.
	You can do math with such values and get a literal result.  Take care to note that
	no geometry can be visualized from a variable containing a value that has any
	mix of symbolic	literal values.</p>
	
	<p>Don't expect GAVisTool to factor your polynomials or solve equations for you.
	It is not that sophsiticated; although stubs in code have been placed for such things
	in the lofty goal of one day providing such features.</p>
	
	<p>While the input text-box has focus, you can press the up and down arrow keys
	to browse your input history.  This is a very useful and convenient feature when
	you're iterating on a line of input until you get it right, or if you ever need
	to recall a previously input command.</p>
	
	<p>One thing you might have noticed in the previous screen-shot is the string "x".
	Officially, there is one and only one data-type in the GAVisTool computation engine,
	and it is the general multivector of a geometric algebra.  The string data-type, however,
	has snuck its way in there as, admittedly, somewhat of a hack.  Strings serve a veriety
	of purposes as input to various functions, but mostly as containers for expressions and
	commands that you want stored for later execution by GAVisTool at a future point in time.
	Examples of this are given in subsequent tutorials.</p>
	
	<h2>The Canvas</h2>
	
	<p>So by now it's clear that you can do a bunch of math in the console window, but
	the entire purpose of GAVisTool is to allow you to visualize the math and interact
	with it graphically.  To that end, go ahead and run the expressions in the following
	screen-shot.  Only type the lines of text that appear left of the "-->" arrows.</p>
	
	<center><img src="images/consolemakesphere.jpg" alt="GAVisTool console create shpere."></center>
	
	<p>The first few lines are straight forward.  We create a position, a radius, and then
	a vector dually representative of a sphere centered at that position and having that
	radius.  The "bind_dual_sphere" function, however, is new.  What this function does,
	and those similarly named, is simply create and bind an interpreter to the given element
	of GA.  This interpreter is responsible for interpreting the given
	element as a piece of geometry under the CGA definition and for displaying that geometry
	in the canvas window.
	You should now see a sphere in your canvas windows as follows.</p>
	
	<center><img src="images/canvasmakesphere.jpg" alt="GAVisTool canvas create sphere."></center>
	
	<p>The thing to realize at this point is that the sphere you see in the canvas window
	and the vector "sphere" in the console window are connected.  Any change you make in the console
	window to the "sphere" variable will be reflected in the canvas window.  Conversley, any change
	you make to the sphere in the canvas window will be reflected in the console window.
	To see this, go ahead and right-click on the sphere to select it; then, holding the CTRL
	key down, left-click and drag to relocate the sphere.  You can also change the radius
	of the sphere by holding the CTRL key down while turning the mouse wheel.</p>
	
	<p>Having changed the sphere in the canvas window, now go ahead and enter "sphere"
	in the console window.  Notice that the value of the vector variable "sphere" has changed.
	It is now the value of a vector of CGA dually representative of the modified sphere
	in the canvas window.</p>
	
	<p>Okay, now go ahead and make a change to the "sphere" vector in the console window.
	For example, you might enter "sphere = sphere + e1".  Notice the change happening to
	the sphere in the canvas window as you repeatedly enter this expression.</p>
	
	<h2>Bind Functions</h2>
	
	<p>At this point we have covered the most basic set of tools for and mode of expirementation
	with the GAVisTool software.  There are more features to be discussed in separate
	tutorials, but to make this tutorial complete, a full list of bind functions for CGA needs
	to be presented.  They are as follows, where in the table below, the asterisk
	may be deleted or replace by "dual_"</p>
	
	<center><table border="1">
		<tr><th>Bind Function</th><th>Create and Bind Geometry</th><th>Dual Grade</th></tr>
		<tr><td>bind_*point</td><td>CGA point</td><td>1-blade</td></tr>
		<tr><td>bind_*sphere</td><td>CGA sphere</td><td>1-blade</td></tr>
		<tr><td>bind_*plane</td><td>CGA plane</td><td>1-blade</td></tr>
		<tr><td>bind_*circle</td><td>CGA circle</td><td>2-blade</td></tr>
		<tr><td>bind_*line</td><td>CGA line</td><td>2-blade</td></tr>
		<tr><td>bind_*pointpair</td><td>CGA point-pair</td><td>3-blade</td></tr>
		<tr><td>bind_*flatpoint</td><td>CGA flat-point</td><td>3-blade</td></tr>
	</table></center>
	
	<p>In this table, the "Dual Grade" column indicates the grade of the blade expected by
	the "dual_" version of the function.  The direct version of the function, (the version
	deleting the asterisk), takes a blade of dual grade with respect to the unit psuedo-scalar
	of the geometric algebra for 3-dimensional CGA.</p>
	
	<p>For any geometry showing up in the canvas window, it can be deleted by using
	the "unbind" function.  Simply pass to this function the name of the variable
	that is bound to the geometry of the canvas window that you want to delete.  For example,
	to unbind the sphere created in the previous section, issue the command "unbind(sphere)".</p>
